WIP	- Updating all code in main.cpp with new API stuff

Dates

	- <=[date] less than or equal to [date]

		- Could do <=., >=., etc
	- Checking whether it actually exists. E.g. 30th February
		
Reschedule
	- -resc / -r switch
	
Groups / Tags
	- Command to list all established groups / tags
		
Task file
